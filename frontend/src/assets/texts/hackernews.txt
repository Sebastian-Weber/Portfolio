My first experience with fetching data from a JSON was with the HackerNews API, which Algolia kindly makes available openly and free of charge for learning. This group project also introduced me to the wonderful world of npm packages. I learned that you don't necessarily have to code components like busy spinners and paginations yourself, but you can if you want. After already working with Bootstrap CSS, this was the first time I used TailwindCSS. I spent hours experimenting with the layout and styling the right card layout for the fetched news items.
In the past, I often got bogged down and lost when trying to write and maintain semantic CSS classes myself. So I was immediately seduced by the possibilities of TailwindCSS. Of course, TailwindCSS doesn't offer all the possibilities that classic CSS offers. But I think the compromises are absolutely worth it and TailwindCSS saves you a lot of work and time that you would spend micromanaging self-written CSS classes.
