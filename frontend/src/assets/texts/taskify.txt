"Taskify" is a to-do list app that was developed as a group project at the WBS Coding School web and app development bootcamp. It was the first project work that took me beyond the basic web technologies of HTML and CSS and introduced me to Javascript and React.js. An interesting observation I made while working on the project was that collaborative wireframing - we used Excalidraw to sketch out our wireframe concept - is not only an extremely valuable tool for UX designers, but it can also be a very helpful strategy for beginners in software development who first need to develop their personal mental model of how UIs work and how they translate into code. Collaborative wireframing allowed us not only to clearly outline and visualize our project idea, but also to take a structured approach to project management and plan the basis for a common code base. Our team consisted of 4 mostly inexperienced people who were new to web development. Some had only been working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a few weeks. "Taskify" is certainly not the gold standard of to-do lists, but the learning curve on this project was enormous. We were four people who had never met before and had very little coding experience. But we managed to code an app with basic functionality using Git, Slack, Excalidraw and Tello as collaboration tools. We were able to deliver an app that worked, looked good, and felt right. Given the lack of experience, I still find this quite impressive and will always remember this little project as my introduction to the processes and technologies of web development :)
